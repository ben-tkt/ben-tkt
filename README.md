## Hello there

I'm just folowing a youtube channel on hnow to build github profile. This is the first one, I will try multiple ones and see which one suits me. 7+ years of engineering education have shaped me into a systematic, inquisitive, and philosophical thinker. Coupled with introspection, further evolving my professional repertoire into that of an empathetic communicator, a skilled planner, and an adept problem solver. Confident in leadership, and yet humble in the journey of lifelong learning. With courage and insights from a diverse background, I seek to continue gaining wisdom, become a positive impact to those around me, and make the world a better place.
